## Should I learn a little css? Yes!!!

- Endless levels of customization by tweaking, creating, inserting your own CSS

<br />

- CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language

<br />

- the good thing is that the most awesome web resource already exists...
  + https://www.w3schools.com/
  + simple explanations for everything you want to know

## Custom CSS
<br />
<br />

- What you cant see is the CSS that styles/formats everything create
- You have the option to code your own styles
- Save these in a custom.css file
- Anything you customize will be used over the defaults
- Set this up in your folder and the YAML

## Custom CSS: Slide color
<br />
<br />

- The default background in awful, but change it to whatever color you want

<br />

slides > slide.backdrop {
  background: white;
}

<br />

- You can customize each individual slide but that gets messy

## Custom CSS: Create a pretty horizontal rule
<hr>
<br />

- The default horizontal rule is too thin 

<br />

hr {
height: 4px;
margin-left: auto;
margin-right: auto;
background-color:#cc2904;
color:#cc2904 ;
border: 0 none;
}

<br />

- Here I set thickness, alignment, color, etc.

## Custom CSS: Text styles
<hr>
<br />

- Very simple to change text color (default is too light)

<br />

slides > slide {

  color: black;

}

<br />

- You can custom colors, alignment, size, fonts of text in the same way
- <strong>Everything is on w3schools.com !!</strong>

## Custom CSS: Setup your title slide
<hr>
<br />

The title slide needs a lot of work.  Browse the custom.css file to see how I have formatted it to something I like

<br />

- gdbar is the rectangular logo to place the logo image in
- Text colors are customized, including h1 and h2, for the title and subtext
- Background color of title slide changed
- Text font changed

## Placing content on slide
<hr>
<br />

- There are some default alternate slide designs that you can utilize
  + 
- You can also customize single slides
- To do this you need to start a new slide with 3 dashes(---) instead of hashtags
  + I tend not to do this, but Ill give an example

## Setting up a two column slides
<hr>
<br />
<br />

<div style="float: right; width: 60%;">

- There are several ways to do this
    + I prefer using HTML <div> tags to define a container for my text
    + This gives me control over the container size
    + This is create for placing text + images together
    + Longer sentences may need a bigger container, making text wrapping prettier

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:225px; LEFT:75px; WIDTH:200px; HEIGHT:300px" SRC="images/tower.jpg">

## Interactive Plots

```{r eruptions}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20),
  
  sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
)

renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser eruption duration")
  
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})
```

## Inline Shiny App

```{r phones}
shinyApp(
  
  ui = fluidPage(
    selectInput("region", "Region:", 
                choices = colnames(WorldPhones)),
    plotOutput("phonePlot")
  ),
  
  server = function(input, output) {
    output$phonePlot <- renderPlot({
      barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region]*1000, 
              ylab = "Number of Telephones", xlab = "Year")
    })
  },
  
  options = list(height = 500)
)
```
