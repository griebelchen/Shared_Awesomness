This is our repo to share how to do cool stuff in R. If you are invited here we think you are awesome...or...you have coding knowledge we plan to leach from you.

Lets make folders named for certain cool R things and stick examples in them. Make examples reproducible (make fake data if you have too) !!!!!!


1. Annes plotting loops (coming soon)

2. Courts Rmarkdown slideshow presentations (STOP using powerpoint!!!!)
Includes a basic slide show and a advanced slide show with Shiny App.

3. Shiny app with ecological data (coming soon)

4. Shun is supposedly good at R and will add cool stuff.
